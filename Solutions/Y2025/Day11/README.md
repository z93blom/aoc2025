## --- Day 11: Reactor ---
You hear some loud beeping coming from a hatch in the floor of the factory, so you decide to check it out. Inside, you find several large electrical conduits and a ladder.

Climbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the beeping: a large, toroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves here are hurriedly running between the reactor and a nearby server rack, apparently trying to fix something.

One of the Elves notices you and rushes over. "It's a good thing you're here! We just installed a new <em>server rack</em>, but we aren't having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!" You glance around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).
